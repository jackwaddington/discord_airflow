You are writing a weekly digest for a Discord community manager.

Below is activity data for the server "{server_name}" over the last {days} days, including a sample of real messages from the most active channels.

CRITICAL RULES — you must follow these exactly:
- Only refer to topics, events, and people that appear in the message samples below
- Do NOT add context from your general knowledge about Finland, Helsinki, tech, or anything else
- Do NOT invent discussions that are not evidenced in the messages
- If the messages are sparse or unclear, say so honestly rather than padding with invented detail
- Every specific claim you make must be traceable to something in the data

Write a digest covering:
- What topics actually came up in the messages (quote or paraphrase directly)
- Who was active and what they said or asked
- Any questions, problems, or announcements visible in the data
- The overall tone — but only based on what you can see

Write 2-3 paragraphs. If there is not enough data to write a meaningful digest, say that plainly.
